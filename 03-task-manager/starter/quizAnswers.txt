1. Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.
In Express.js, middleware is like a helper that manages requests as they move through your app.
It's like a middleman between the incoming request and the final response.
You can use middleware to do various tasks like checking if a user is logged in, formatting data, or handling errors.
You just plug them in using app.use().
It's handy because it keeps your code organized and makes it easier to build cool features.


2. What does CRUD stand for?
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete.
It represents the basic operations performed on data in a database or application:
creating new data, reading existing data, updating existing data, and deleting data.

3. You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
    1. How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?
    You access information in the .env file using environment variables with the help of a package dotenv in your Node.js application.

    2. How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your Github repository?
    To keep your .env file from getting uploaded to GitHub, you simply list it in the .gitignore file.
